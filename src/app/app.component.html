<!--
    For the side drawer, we encapsulate de router and we add inside it a StackLayout
    to which we assign a specific directive called 'tkDrawerContent'

    This package will basically look for an element with this 'tkDrawerContent' attribute on
    it and it will take the content that sits inside the Layout and move it into the drawer that opens

    Additinaly you should also make sure that you mark the main content over whihc the drawer sits
    and you use the 'tkMainContent' attribute
-->
<RadSideDrawer>
  <FlexboxLayout tkDrawerContent class="drawer-container">
    <Button
      text="Logout"
      class="btn btn-primary btn-rounded-lg"
      nsRouterLink="/"
      [clearHistory]="true"
      (tap)="onLogout()"
    ></Button>
  </FlexboxLayout>
  <StackLayout tkMainContent>
    <page-router-outlet></page-router-outlet>
  </StackLayout>
</RadSideDrawer>
